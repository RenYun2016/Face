Learning_based_saliency_detection_on_face_images

In this file, all data of eye tracking in our experiment is available.

"images": 510 images with faces (1920*1080p)

"eyedata": fixations provided by images

"All_subjects_data":fixations provided by subjects

"original_experiment_data": original data of our experiments, including subjects imformation, image names, orignal fixations and so on.

you can see the fixations by the following steps:
In the matlab work file "Learning_based_saliency_detection_on_face_images"
add file "eyedata" and "images" to your matlan work path
run image_show_fixations.m in MATLAB, you can see all fixations plot in the images

By the way, six images are duplicates. The orders of images displaying are available in our database. If you are intersted in the field corresponding with the duplicates, you can refer to the data.
